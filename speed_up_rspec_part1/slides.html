<h3>Speed up rspec tests - part1</h3>

<h2>Example feature spec</h2>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">describe 'Lists', type: :feature, js: true do
  before do
    # time consuming setup which takes about 6s
  end

  # each it takes about 1 second
  it 'should be able to browse lists' do
  end

  it 'should be able to edit a list' do
  end

  it 'should be able to add companies to list' do
  end

  it 'should be able to remove companies from list' do
  end

  it 'should be able to delete a list' do
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>How long it takes ?</h2>
<pre><code>rspec spec/features/lists_spec.rb

.....

Finished in 35.34 seconds (files took 9.99 seconds to load)
5 examples, 0 failures

</code></pre>

<h2>How to speed up ?</h2>

<p>We can combine all tests cases into one so that before hook will execute only once.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">describe 'Lists', type: :feature, js: true do
  before do
    # time consuming setup which takes about 6s
  end

  it "should be able to manage lists" do
    #should be able to edit a list
    ...
    #should be able to add companies to list
    ...
    #should be able to remove companies from list
    ...
    #should be able to delete a list
    ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>We can do it better!</h2>

<p>Use aggregate_failures from rspec</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'spec_helper'

describe 'Lists', type: :feature, js: true do
  before do
    # time consuming setup which takes about 6s
  end

  it 'should be able to manage lists' do
    aggregate_failures 'should be able to browse lists' do
    end

    aggregate_failures 'should be able to edit a list' do
    end

    aggregate_failures 'should be able to add companies to list' do
    end

    aggregate_failures 'should be able to remove companies from list' do
    end

    aggregate_failures 'should be able to delete a list' do
    end
  end
end

<h2>How long it takes ?</h2>

.

<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tests runs 3x times faster</li>
  <li>Tests becomes dependant on each other</li>
</ul>

</section>

<h2>What happens when some test fails ?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>By default all next aggregate_failures within block will not execute</li>
  <li>We can change this by adding aggregate_failures metadata and then all aggregate_failures will be executed and rspec will report all errors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What about controllers ?</h2>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">describe CompanyOfficesController, type: :controller do
  describe '#create' do
    it 'validates params' do
      sign_in user
      post :create, name: ''
      expect(response).to render_template('new')
      expect(flash[:error]).not_to be_nil
    end

    it 'creates record when params are valid' do
      sign_in user
      expect do
        post :create, name: 'My office'
      end.to change(CompanyOffice, :count).by 1
    end

    it 'creates record when params are valid and redirect to index' do
      sign_in user
      post :create, name: 'My office'
      expect(response).to redirect_to(company_offices_path)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Using aggregate_failures</h2>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">describe CompanyOfficesController, type: :controller do
  describe '#create' do
    it 'creates office' do
      sign_in user

      aggregate_failures 'validates params' do
        post :create, name: ''
        expect(response).to render_template('new')
        expect(flash[:error]).not_to be_nil
      end

      aggregate_failures 'creates record when params are valid and redirect' do
        expect do
          post :create, name: 'My office'
        end.to change(CompanyOffice, :count).by 1
        expect(response).to redirect_to(company_offices_path)
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I encourage to use this for all features specs and some controller specs which uses the same setup.</p>

<p>Questions ?</p>
